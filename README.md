# ASP.NET Core: Razor Pages
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course ASP.NET Core: Razor Pages. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

![ASP.NET Core: Razor Pages][lil-thumbnail-url] 

Razor Pages allows you to build ASP.NET web applications quickly and easily without an MVC framework. In this course, instructor Ervis Trupja shows you how to create a Razor Pages application, use the PageModel, and manage dependencies as you go. Find out how to get your first dynamically rendered page up and running before you learn about data binding, working with forms and data, and securing your application with authorization and authentication. Along the way, explore the use of layouts and classes to optimize pages for maintainability and more. Ervis shows you the skills you need to know to get the most out of Razor Pages and set your sights on next-level applications.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"

## Installing
